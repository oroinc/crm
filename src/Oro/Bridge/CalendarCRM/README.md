# OroCalendarCRMBridgeBundle

OroCalendarCRMBridgeBundle is a bridge that integrates features of the [OroCalendarBundle](https://github.com/oroinc/OroCalendarBundle) into OroCRM applications.

The bundle enables the Calendar Events [activity](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ActivityBundle) for the Contact, Case, Account, Lead, Opportunity, B2bCustomer entities, and enables users to create Calendar Events from the pages of these entities with the appropriate prefilled event context.
