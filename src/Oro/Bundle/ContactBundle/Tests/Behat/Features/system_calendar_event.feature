  In order to have global system events
  As an Administrator
  I need to be able to manage system calendar events

  Scenario: Check displaying calendar event activity list item
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to Customers/ Contacts
    And I click View Charlie Sheen in grid
    When I click on "Calendar Activity Item"
